              We founded VAC because we hated how complicated it was to buy a car. You only have so much free time in
              your life. You donâ€™t want to waste it going to different car dealerships every weekend for weeks and
              months trying to track down the right car.
            </div>
            <div className={styles.subtitle}>
              We also hated how choosing a car and figuring out the financing for the vehicle were treated as totally
              separate processes! Instead of dealing with a salesperson, then being handed off to a closer, and then
              shuffled over to a finance manager, we wanted to create a way for people to buy a car and only deal with a
              single person for the entire process.
